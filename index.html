            Hello! My name is Scott Taylor and I am a web developer currently enrolled in the University of Washington
            Coding Bootcamp. Prior to my enrollment in the UW Coding Bootcamp, I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in
            Communication with an emphasis on advertising from Washington State University. After graduation, I returned
            back to Seattle where I worked for a small business (Eastside Audio Video) in Bellevue as a Sales Associate
            and their Assistant Marketing Director. Following my time with Eastside Audio Video, I have been working for
            a Seattle based clothing company, Cutter & Buck. At Cutter & Buck I have worked in sales and account
            management within our wholesale divisions, specifically with golf, team, and specialty retail accounts.

        <P2>
            After a few years in the workforce, I have decided to further my education and delve into the world of
            coding. Coding has always been an interest of mine and only recently have I decided that it is the best path
            for me to continue down. Within the world of coding I see opportunities to combine creativity,
            problem-solving and logic to develop innovative and useful applications. Additionally, with the changing
            landscape of the job market in the Seattle area, I feel strongly that coding is the future. On top of my
            coding experience, I also have experience working with a variety of Adobe applications such as InDesign,
            Illustrator, and Photoshop.
        </P2>

        <br>
        <p3>
            Moving forward, I am excited for the opportunities that a coding education will provide me. I am eager to
            create and develop solutions to problems. To find out more or to set up a meeting, please visit my contact
            page and leave me a note.
