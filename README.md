Scott Taylor Portfolio

The following webpage is a portfolio designed to showcase the work I have done both in and out of the UW Coding Bootcamp.  A portfolio is a critical tool for a developer, as it allows the outside world to see what I am working on and what I am capable of as a developer.  Designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components, this portfolio is made up of 3 separate pages; an about/home page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.  These 3 pages are accessible from the navigation bar located in the top-right corner of the page.  Clicking on each link leads the user to the requested page. The Navigation bar is a bootstrap component.

The about page contains some basic information on my background and some of the skills that I have developed throughout my career.  This also contains some information on how I am looking to impact the industry and some interests of mine.

Next, the portfolio page will showcase different projects that I have worked on.  Currently, this just displays some different images related to my background.   Images include a Washington State University logo (Iâ€™m a proud Coug, class of 2016), a logo of Cutter & Buck (my current employer), a logo of Eastside Audio Video (first job out of college), and my home town of Seattle.  All images are in a thumbnail format with a rounded border from a bootstrap component.  As I begin to work on projects, each will be placed in a grid with a thumbnail and link to the specific site.

Lastly, I have included a contact page.  Here, visitors to my portfolio can reach out for questions and inquiries using a form.  The form includes a place for a name, email address, and comment section.

All together, each page has a base layout I created.  This layout includes a header with the navigation bar, as well as a container where content can be placed in a central viewing location, and a footer at the bottom of the page. Each layout is responsive based one the screen size.  When the screen size decreases, components within the navigation bar and container respond by shrinking in size and shifting layout to accommodate the new screen size.
